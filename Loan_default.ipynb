    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial institutions such as banks, microfinance firms, and lending startups face significant risks when issuing loans. A major challenge is accurately assessing the probability that a borrower will default. Loan defaults can lead to substantial financial losses, negatively impact liquidity, and increase the overall cost of lending. To mitigate these risks, lenders rely on data-driven risk assessment models that can evaluate borrower profiles and predict their likelihood of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a Loan Default Prediction System using an ensemble machine learning approach. By leveraging customer demographic, financial, and behavioral data, we will build a predictive model that classifies borrowers into high-risk (likely to default) and low-risk (unlikely to default) categories. The system will not only provide accurate risk scores but also ensure interpretability, enabling financial institutions to justify lending decisions to regulators and stakeholders."

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "- The business problem centers on minimizing loan default risk by improving the accuracy of loan approval decisions. Traditional credit scoring models (e.g., FICO score) may overlook key behavioral and contextual factors. Therefore, a machine learning model that integrates financial, demographic, and behavioral indicators can provide a more holistic and accurate risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Objectives:**\n",
    "1. Reduce default rates by accurately identifying high-risk applicants.\n",
    "2. Improve portfolio profitability through better lending decisions.\n",
    "3. Enhance customer segmentation by distinguishing between safe and risky borrowers.\n",
    "4. Maintain regulatory compliance by ensuring model interpretability (explainable AI).\n",
    "5. Enable real-time decision-making via model deployment as an API or web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria**\n",
    "- Technical Success: Achieve a model with high predictive performance, measured using AUC-ROC, precision, and recall, ensuring balanced performance between identifying defaults and minimizing false alarms.\n",
    "- Business Success: Reduce financial losses from defaults, improve loan portfolio quality, and increase customer trust by using a transparent and explainable risk scoring system.\n",
    "- Operational Success: Seamless integration of the model into business workflows via deployment (API or dashboard), with proper monitoring and periodic retraining."
